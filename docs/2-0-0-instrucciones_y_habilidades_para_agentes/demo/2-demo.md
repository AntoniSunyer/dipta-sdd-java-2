# Session 2.

## 1. Commands

### 1.1 Codify as a command prompt

> `/.agents/prompts/codify.prompt.md` or `/.agents/commands/codify.md`

```yaml
---
name : codify
description : Write code to implement a feature.
parameters : A request or a specification file with a feature or bug to fix.
---
```

- [codify.md](../1-ecosystem-vibes/assets/1-codify.md) contains the detailed guidelines for the codify command prompt.

---

## 2. Initialize

### 2.1 AGENTS.md to rule them all

> `initialize this project` 

```yaml
---
name : initialize
description : Initialize the environment by loading all necessary commands, rules, and skills. This should be the first skill activated to set up the context for subsequent tasks.
---
```

- [initialize.md](./assets/2-initizalize.md) to be copied to `/.agents/skills/initialize/SKILL.md`.

- [AGENTS.template.md](./assets/2-AGENTS.template.md) to be copied to `/.agents/skills/initialize/AGENTS.template.md`.

### 2.2 Language rules

> `/.agents/instructions/java.instructions.md` or `/.agents/rules/java.md`

```yaml
---
name : java
description : Java coding standards for Spring Boot services; naming, immutability, Optional usage, streams, exceptions, generics, and project layout. 
applyTo : back/**/*.java

```

- [java.md](./assets/2-java.md) contains the detailed coding rules for Java in Spring Boot services.

## 3. Skills

### 3.1 Refactor as a skill set

> `codify this requirement or implement this specification file`

```yaml
---
name : codify
description : Write code to implement a feature, following the codify command prompt guidelines. To be used to implement features or fix bugs ensuring code quality and maintainability.
---
```

> `follow java rules` 

```yaml
---
name : java
description : Java coding standards for Spring Boot services: naming, immutability, Optional usage, streams, exceptions, generics, and project layout. To be used as a reference for writing or reviewing Java code in the back-end service, ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices.
---
```

- [java.md](./assets/2-java.md) to be copied to `/.agents/skills/java/SKILL.md`.

### 3.2 Fallbacks

- ClaudeCode, Codex, Cursor and Copilot can read skills and use them automatically.
- With IntelliJ you can mention the `@skill-name/SKILL.md` in the prompt to use it.
