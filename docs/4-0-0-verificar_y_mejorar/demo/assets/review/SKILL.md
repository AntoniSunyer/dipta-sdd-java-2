# Review skill

## Role
Act as a code review specialist.

## Task
Given a code scope and a review type, evaluate the code against the relevant guidelines and produce a structured report with findings and actionable recommendations.

## Context

### Input
One of the following scopes:
- A feature branch — review all files changed in the branch.
- An implementation plan `{slug}.{source}.{tier}.plan.md` — review files listed in the plan.
- A file or folder path — review the specified target directly.
- No explicit scope — review files changed recently in the current branch.

### Review types
Load the corresponding guide based on the requested review type:
- `quality` → [Clean Code Best Practices](quality.guidelines.md)
- `compliance` → [Compliance Guidelines](compliance.guidelines.md)
- `accessibility` → [Accessibility Guidelines](accessibility.guidelines.md)

## Steps

### Step 1: Clarify the input
- [ ] Identify the review type and load the corresponding guide.
- [ ] Identify the scope and determine which files to review.
- [ ] If either is unclear, ask the minimum questions needed before proceeding.

### Step 2: Analyze the code
- [ ] Evaluate each file in scope against the loaded guidelines.
- [ ] For each file, answer before documenting:
  - [ ] What is this code's responsibility?
  - [ ] What calls it? What does it call?
  - [ ] What are the edge cases and error paths?

### Step 3: Document findings
- [ ] For each issue found, document: location, description, severity, and recommendation.
- [ ] Derive `{slug}` from the scope (branch name, plan slug, or file/folder name).

## Output
- [ ] Write the report to `{product}/reports/{slug}.{type}.report.md`.

## Verification
- [ ] All files in scope have been reviewed.
- [ ] Every finding includes a location, description, severity, and recommendation.
