# Rockets Fleet Management

## Problem definition
— As an operator, I want to **register a rocket with its capacity and range of action** to enable its use in launch planning.
— As an operator, I want to **consult the rocket catalog** to quickly select a vehicle compatible with the destination.
— As an operator, I want to **update the operational data of a rocket** to maintain reliable information for business decisions.
— As an operator, I want to **decommission a rocket** to prevent its use in future launches.

## Solution overview
### Data Model
— Rocket:
— id: uuid#
— name: string#
— capacity: number, [1..9]
— range: enum, (Earth, Moon, Mars)
— decommissioned: boolean?

### Backend API
— An endpoint to create a rocket with its capacity and range of action.
— An endpoint to consult the rocket catalog.
— An endpoint to update the operational data of a rocket.
— An endpoint to decommission a rocket.

### Frontend Application
— A form to register a new rocket with its capacity and range of action.
— A view to consult the rocket catalog.
— A form to update the operational data of a rocket.
— A button to decommission a rocket.

## Acceptance and Release
— [ ] IF a new rocket is registered with valid data, THEN it should be added to the catalog.
— [ ] IF the rocket catalog is consulted, THEN it should display all registered rockets.
— [ ] IF a rocket's operational data is updated, THEN the changes should be reflected in the catalog.
— [ ] IF a rocket is decommissioned, THEN it should no longer be available for future launches.
— [ ] WHEN invalid data is provided, THEN the system should return appropriate error messages.
— [ ] WHEN a rocket is found by its ID, THEN the system should return a not found error.
